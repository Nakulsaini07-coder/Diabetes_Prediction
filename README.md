# Diabetes Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic features.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Using a labeled medical dataset of patients, we aim to train a model that predicts diabetes using features like glucose level, BMI, insulin, etc. This helps in early detection and preventive care.

## ✅ Results
- Model: SVM classifier with linear kernel 
- Accuracy: ~76%
- Evaluation: Accuracy score, basic analysis (Confusion Matrix & Classification Report can be added)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files
- `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook
- Dataset: The dataset `diabetes.csv` is already included in this repository for easy access.
## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or Colab

## 📊 Future Improvements
- Add confusion matrix and classification report
- Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Create a Streamlit app for live predictions
